# A Curated List of AI Tools and Resources

A comprehensive list of AI chatbots, tools, and resources for generation, coding, writing, and more.

**Note:** It is **never** a good idea to upload anything personal or confidential to cloud-based AIs, as many of them use your prompts for data collection or training. For privacy, it's best to run large language models (LLMs) locally.
